##### RBAC : Role Based Access Control - Lab
https://uklabs.kodekloud.com/topic/practice-test-role-based-access-controls-2/


Inspect the environment and identify the authorization modes configured on the cluster.
Check the kube-apiserver settings. : `Node,RBAC`
```BASH 
# Here, you have 2 alternative to identify the authorization modes configured on the cluster
# One, directly check on kube-apiserver pods via kubectl command
kubectl describe pods kube-apiserver-controlplane -n=kube-system|less
# Second, view the manifest of the kube-apiserver
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml |less
```

How many roles exist in the default namespace? : `0`
```BASH 
kubectl get roles
```


How many roles exist in all namespaces together?
```BASH 
kubectl get roles --all-namespaces --no-headers | wc -l
12
```

What are the resources the kube-proxy role in the kube-system namespace is given access to? : `configmaps`
```BASH 
# Identify the namespace where kube-proxy is
kubectl get roles -n=kube-system

# Now get the information we need
kubectl describe roles kube-proxy -n=kube-system
PolicyRule:
  Resources   Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------   -----------------  --------------  -----
  configmaps  []                 [kube-proxy]    [get]
```


What actions can the kube-proxy role perform on configmaps? : `get`
```BASH 
# We can answer this without going typing another command
```


6-
Which of the following statements are true?
```BASH 
# kube-proxy can get details of all configMaps objects by the name `kube-proxy`
```


7-
Which account is the kube-proxy role assigned to? (I don't understand well)
```BASH 
kubectl describe rolebinding kube-proxy -n=kube-system
```


8-
user dev-user is created. User's details have been added to the kubeconfig file. Inspect the permissions granted to the user. Check if the user can list pods in the default namespace.

Use the --as dev-user option with kubectl to run commands as the dev-user. : `dev-user doesn't have permission to list pods`
```BASH 
# To check the new created user
kubectl config view

k get pods --as dev-user
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "dev-user" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "default"
```


9-
Create the necessary roles and role bindings required for the `dev-user` to create, list and delete pods in the `default` namespace.
```BASH 
# Use the given spec:
# Role: developer
# Role Resources: pods
# Role Actions: list
# Role Actions: create
# Role Actions: delete
# RoleBinding: dev-user-binding
# RoleBinding: Bound to dev-user

# Instead of configuration files, you can use the 
kubectl create role --help

# dev-user-role.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: developer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["list", "create", "delete"]


# dev-user-role-binding.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
# You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: dev-user-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
# You can specify more than one "subject"
- kind: User
  name: dev-user # "name" is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: developer # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io


# Once each file created, we will create configs||resources with those commands:
kubectl create -f dev-user-role.yaml
kubectl create -f dev-user-role-binding.yaml

# If an error occur, change your file(s) and use those commands
kubectl replace -f dev-user-role.yaml
kubectl delete rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io dev-user-binding 
kubectl replace -f dev-user-role-binding.yaml
```



10-
A set of new roles and role-bindings are created in the blue namespace for the dev-user. However, the dev-user is unable to get details of the dark-blue-app pod in the blue namespace. Investigate and fix the issue.


We have created the required roles and rolebindings, but something seems to be wrong.
```BASH 
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=blue

k edit role developer
# and change the ressource name or add a new one
```


11-
Add a new rule in the existing role developer to grant the dev-user permissions to create deployments in the blue namespace.

Remember to add api group "apps".
```BASH 
k edit role developer 

# updated content
#
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-03-19T23:06:57Z"
  name: developer
  namespace: blue
  resourceVersion: "1585"
  uid: 210f4194-d01d-441e-b554-347e9ee7bd73
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - apps
  resourceNames:
  - blue-app
  resources:
  - pods
  - deployments
  verbs:
  - get
  - watch
  - create
  - delete
- apiGroups:
  - apps
  resources:
  - deployments
  verbs:
  - create


# Test this command to check if every things is ok
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --as dev-user -n blue
```
